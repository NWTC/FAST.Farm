FAST.Farm is a multi-physics engineering tool for predicting the performance and loads of wind turbines within a wind farm. 
FAST.Farm uses FAST to solve the aero-hydro-servo-elastic dynamics of an individual turbine, but adds additional physics for wind 
farm-wide ambient wind in the atmospheric boundary layer; a wind-farm super controller; and wake deficits, advection, deflection, 
meandering, and merging. FAST.Farm is based on the principles of the Dynamic Wake Meandering (DWM) model—including passive tracer 
modeling of wake meandering—but addresses many of the limitations of previous DWM limitations. While a high-performance computer 
is required to model a complete wind farm, FAST.Farm maintains computational efficiency to support iterative and probabilistic design. 
Applications of FAST.Farm include reducing wind farm underperformance and loads uncertainty, developing wind farm controls to enhance 
operation, optimizing wind farm siting and topology, and innovating the design of wind turbines for the wind-farm environment.
